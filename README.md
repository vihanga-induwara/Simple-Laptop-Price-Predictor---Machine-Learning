# Simple Laptop Price Predictor - Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the price of laptops based on different specifications like brand, processor type, RAM, storage, etc. It was created for learning purposes and was inspired by the YouTube channel CodeProLK.

## Project Description

In this project, I used machine learning to predict laptop prices. The data includes various features such as brand, processor type, RAM size, storage, and more. The model is trained using this data to predict the price of a laptop based on the input specifications.

## Features

- Predict laptop price based on specifications.
- Simple interface for inputting laptop details.
- Machine learning model that learns from data and predicts prices.

## Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib (to save and load the model)

You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your PC. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Simple-Laptop-Price-Predictor.git
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd Simple-Laptop-Price-Predictor
```

### Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### Step 5: Activate the Virtual Environment

- On Windows: 
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On MacOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 6: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

### Step 7: Set Up the Machine Learning Model

Before running the web app, you need to train the machine learning model and save it. Train the model using sample data (replace `laptop_data.csv` with your dataset):

```python
# model.py
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('laptop_data.csv')

# Prepare features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data[['Brand', 'Processor', 'RAM', 'Storage']]  # features
y = data['Price']  # target

# Convert categorical variables to numerical values
X = pd.get_dummies(X)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'laptop_price_predictor.pkl')
```

This will save the trained model as `laptop_price_predictor.pkl`, which you will later use in the web application.

### Step 8: Run the Flask Application

Once you’ve saved the model, you can run the Flask application. Here’s the code to start the web app:

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import joblib
import numpy as np

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('laptop_price_predictor.pkl')

# Initialize the Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get the data from the form
    brand = request.form['brand']
    processor = request.form['processor']
    ram = int(request.form['ram'])
    storage = int(request.form['storage'])

    # Prepare the input data
    input_data = np.array([brand, processor, ram, storage]).reshape(1, -1)

    # Make the prediction
    predicted_price = model.predict(input_data)

    return render_template('result.html', price=predicted_price[0])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Make sure to place this `app.py` in the same directory as your trained model (`laptop_price_predictor.pkl`). This Flask app will create a simple web interface where users can input laptop details, and the model will predict the price.
